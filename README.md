# Smart-Face-Front-End
> A small project that doesn't do that much!  (But what it does, it does pretty well.)

I made this app to showcase clean, simple react code,rock-solid authentication, API integration, a node/express server, and a small database.

Just sign in and paste a link to a photo in the box.  Smart Face will detect faces in it, and put a blue box around the face!
